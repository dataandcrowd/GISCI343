## How will we cover it?

* **<span style="color:blue">Google Colab (by default)</span>**
* Install Python on your machine (Optional)
* Jupyter lab / Notebook / VS Code (Optional)

![](Figs/colab.png){.absolute top=50 right=100 width="300" height="200"}

&nbsp;

Make sure you are well set up with Google Colab using the URL below:
<center><span style="color:blue;">https://colab.research.google.com</span></center>



## Helpdesk
* Wednesday 12pm-2pm: Lab Sessions
* Ed discussion is the place to go!


## What will we cover for today?
* Simple Python 
* Variables
* Data types
* Lists
* `for` loops
* Conditional Statements


## For the first time
* Let's type

```python
print("Hello World")
```




## Simple Python maths


```python 
1 + 1

5 * 7

2**3

10 % 2
```



## End-of-Line Terminates a statement

```python
temperature = 5
```

* This is an assignment operation, where we've created a variable named `temperature` and assigned it the value 5. 
* Notice that the end of this statement is simply marked by the end of the line.


::: {.incremental}

```python
x = 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 +\
    5 + 6 + 7 + 8
```

* In Python, if you'd like a statement to continue to the next line, it is possible to use the &#92; marker to indicate this:

:::



## Whitespace Within Lines Does Not Matter
* `White space` within lines of Python code does not matter. 
* For example, all three of these expressions are equivalent

```python
x=1+2
x = 1 + 2
x             =        1    +                2
```

::: {.incremental}

* Which line of code do you think is more <span style="color:blue">readable</span>?

:::


## Round brackets (Parentheses)

```python
2 * (3 + 4)
```
* They can be used in the typical way to group statements or mathematical operations

```python
print('first value:', 1)
```

* Indicate that a function is being called. `print()`

```python
L = [4,2,3,1]
L.sort()
print(L)
```

* The "()" after sort indicates that the function should be executed
* required even if no arguments are necessary


## Python Semantics: Variables
* A <span style="color:blue;">**variable**</span> can be used to store values calculated in expressions and used for other calculations
* A variable is a location in memory.

![](Figs/variable-diagram-different-values.png){fig-align="center"}

```python
weather = "Freezing"

print(weather)
```


---

### Variable as pointer

```python
x = [1, 2, 3]
y = x
```
* You have created two variables x and y which both point to the same object.

```python
x = 'something else'
print(y)  # y is unchanged
```
* This makes perfect sense if you think of x and y as pointers
* The "=" operator as an operation that changes what the name points to.


## Everything Is an Object

* Python is an object-oriented programming language, and in Python everything is an object.
* What does this mean?


```python
x = 4
type(x)

x = 'hello'
type(x)

x = 3.14159
type(x)

```



::: {.incremental}

* Python everything is an object
* This means every entity has some metadata (called attributes) and associated functionality (called methods). 
* These attributes and methods are accessed via the dot syntax.

:::


---

### `append` method

```python
L = [1, 2, 3]
L.append(100)
print(L)
```
* For example, before we saw that lists have an append method, which adds an item to the list, and is accessed via the dot (`.`) syntax:

&nbsp;

* Try this

```python
x = 4.5
x.is_integer()

x = 4.0
x.is_integer()
```

## Operators {.smaller}



- **Addition (`a + b`)** – Sum of `a` and `b`
- **Subtraction (`a - b`)** – Difference of `a` and `b`
- **Multiplication (`a * b`)** – Product of `a` and `b`
- **True division (`a / b`)** – Quotient of `a` and `b`
- **Floor division (`a // b`)** – Quotient of `a` and `b`, removing fractional parts
- **Modulus (`a % b`)** – Integer remainder after division of `a` by `b`
- **Exponentiation (`a ** b`)** – `a` raised to the power of `b`
- **Negation (`-a`)** – The negative of `a`


```python
# True division
print(11 / 2)

# Floor division
print(11 // 2)
```

## Comparison Operations
* Another type of operation which can be very useful is comparison of different values.


- **Equality (`a == b`)** – `a` is equal to `b`
- **Inequality (`a != b`)** – `a` is not equal to `b`
- **Less than (`a < b`)** – `a` is less than `b`
- **Greater than (`a > b`)** – `a` is greater than `b`
- **Less than or equal to (`a <= b`)** – `a` is less than or equal to `b`
- **Greater than or equal to (`a >= b`)** – `a` is greater than or equal to `b`



```python
# 25 is odd?
25 % 2 == 1

# 66 is odd?
66 % 2 == 1
```

## Boolean Operations (and or not)

When working with Boolean values, Python provides operators to combine the values using the standard concepts of "and", "or", and "not". 

```python

x = 4
(x < 6) and (x > 2)

(x > 10) or (x % 2 == 0)

not (x < 6)
```



## Built-In Types: Simple values
* A <span style="color:blue;">*data type*</span> determines the characteristics of data in a programme
* Basic data types in Python.

| Data type name | Data type            | Example |
|----------------|----------------------|---------|
| `int`            | Whole integer values | 4       |
| `float`          | Decimal values       | 3.1415  |
| `str`            | Character strings    | 'Freezing'   |
| `bool`           | True/false values    | True    |

---

### Data types: Strings

Strings (str) represent sequences of characters, e.g. I love GIS, Python is awesome, 1990. Note that a number will be of the type string when declared within quotations marks ("").


::: {style="font-size: 150%;"}

```python
print("hello world") # print strings

len("hello world") # to count text in Python Shell
print(len("hello world")) # in Python Notebook
```

:::

---

```{python}
#| echo: true

weatherForecast = "Freezing"
type(weatherForecast)

```


* We can concatenate strings using the addition operator:

```python
print(weatherForecast+weatherForecast)

print(5 * weatherForecast)

```

* We also can perform upper and lower case transformations:


```python
print(weatherForecast.upper())
print(weatherForecast.lower())
```

---

### Data types: Numeric
* Addition
* Subtraction
* Multiplication
* Division

```python
my_int= 2
my_float= 24.3

my_int+my_float
my_int-my_float

```
---

### Data types: Numeric (more)

* Floor Division: `//` operator is used to perform integer division (rounding down to the nearest integer).
* Modulo: `%` operator returns the remainder of the division operation.
* Exponentiation

```python
10//3
10%3
2**3
```

---

### Data types: Boolean

- booleans allow us to test logic
- booleans give us the power of conditionals

```python
x = 5
y = 4
print(x > y)
print(not(x > y)()

```

---

### Your Turn

* Print the `type()` of: 

::: {style="font-size: 150%;"}
  - 153
  - 8.8354
  - Windy
  - False

:::


## Built-In Data Structures

* Python has several built-in compound types, which act as containers for other types. 
* These compound types are:
  - **List (`list`)** – Example: `[1, 2, 3]` – Ordered collection
  - **Tuple (`tuple`)** – Example: `(1, 2, 3]` – Immutable ordered collection
  - **Dictionary (`dict`)** – Example: `{'a':1, 'b':2, 'c':3}` – Unordered (key, value) mapping

&nbsp;

* We will cover list in the lecture, and other in lab hours


---

### Lists
When we have more clothes/items we would like to align similar types of clothes into a drawer

![](Figs/drawer.png){fig-align="center"}

---

### List Example 1

::: {style="font-size: 150%;"}

```python
top = ["socks", "underwear", "handkerchief"]
middle = ["T-shirts", "Pajamas", "Trousers", "Shorts"]
bottom = [30, 73, 100, 62]
```
&nbsp;

```python
print(top[0])
print(min(bottom))
```

```
socks  # <- index "an element of a list"
30     # <- the smallest element of the list
```
:::

---

### List Example 2

Let’s first create a list of selected station_name values and print it to the screen.

```{python}
#| echo: true

western_line = [
    "Britomart",
    "Parnell",
    "Newmarket",
    "Grafton",
    "Mt Eden",
    "Kingsland",
    "Morningside",
    "Baldwin Ave"
]

western_line
```

```{python}
#| echo: true
type(western_line)
```

---

### Index values
To access an individual value in the list we need to use an **index** value.

```{python}
#| echo: true

western_line[1]
```

Python returns 'Parnell' instead of 'Waitematā'. Can anybody guess why?

---

### Index values

```{python}
#| echo: true

western_line[2]
western_line[2:5]
western_line[-1]
western_line[-8]
```

---

### Modifying list values

::: {style="font-size: 150%;"}

```{python}
#| echo: true
western_line[3] = 'Auckland City'
western_line
```

:::



---

### Adding list values

::: {style="font-size: 150%;"}

```{python}
#| echo: true

western_line.append("new station")
print(western_line)
```

:::


## <span style="color:green;">Your Turn!</span> {.smaller}
1. Define `western_line` in your environment
2. Add **Mt Albert, Avondale, New Lynn, Fruitvale Rd, Glen Eden** as a list (you can Google "Auckland Western Line" and find the Wikipedia)
3. Assign that in your environment as `more_western`
4. This time, try `extend` to combine the two lists

::: {style="font-size: 150%;"}

```python
western_line = ["Britomart", "Parnell", "Newmarket", "Grafton",
    "Mt Eden", "Kingsland", "Morningside", "Baldwin Ave"]
```

## Documentation
* At this point, you might think, *Hang on, do I have to memorise everything?*
* The answer is **NO**
* If you are stuck, visit https://www.python.org/doc
* Google your problem (Stackoverflow)
* ChatGPT and Gemini (🧐)






## `for` loop
* Loops allow parts of code to be repeated some number of times
* Iterates over all of the items in a Python list and performing a calculation on each item.

### `for` loop: concept

&nbsp;

::: {style="font-size: 150%;"}

```python
for variable in collection:
    do things with variable
```
:::


::: {style="font-size: 70%;"}
Let’s break down the code above to see some essential aspect of `for` loops:

* The `variable` can be any name you like.
* The statement of the `for` loop must end with a colon (:)
* The code that should be executed as part of the loop must be indented beneath the `for` loop statement. 
* The typical indentation is **4 spaces**.
* There is no additional special word needed to end the loop, you simply change the indentation back to normal.

### Your daily for loop

```python
for day in my_life:
    wake_up()
    take_shower()
    eat_breakfast()
    brush_teeth()
    ride_beam()
    come_to_lecture()
    ...
```

![](Figs/schedule.jpg){.absolute top=150 right=0 width=40%}

---

### for loop: an example

::: {style="font-size: 150%;"}

```python
for name in western_line:
    print(name)
```
```
Britomart 
Parnell
Newmarket 
Grafton
Mt Eden
Kingsland
Morningside
Baldwin Ave
```


:::

---

### Different example
::: {style="font-size: 110%;"}
```python
european_cities = ["Amsterdam", "Brussels", "London", "Rome"]

for city in european_cities:
    print(city)
```
:::

---

### Examples using `range`

::: {style="font-size: 150%;"}
```{python}
#| echo: true

for value in range(5):
    print(value)
```
:::

---

### Examples using `range`

::: {style="font-size: 150%;"}
```{python}
#| echo: true

group1 = [1, 3, 5]
group2 = [0, 1, 2]

for i in range(2):
    print(group1[i], group2[i])
```
:::

---

## Your Turn!

::: {style="font-size: 105%;"}

```python
cities = ["Helsinki", "Stockholm", "Oslo", "Reykjavik", "Copenhagen"]
countries = ["Finland", "Sweden", "Norway", "Iceland", "Denmark"]

```
:::

* The indices of the cities and countries are in the same order
* For example, Helsinki and Finland are in index 0
* Create a `for` loop that describes something like *Helsinki is the capital of Finland*


---

### Examples using two lists - Answers
::: {style="font-size: 120%;"}

```python
for i in range(5):
    print(cities[i], "is the capital of", countries[i])
    
for i in range(len(cities)):
    print(cities[i], "is the capital of", countries[i])
```
:::


&nbsp; 

```
Helsinki is the capital of Finland
Stockholm is the capital of Sweden
Oslo is the capital of Norway
Reykjavik is the capital of Iceland
Copenhagen is the capital of Denmark
```



## Conditional statements
* We will learn how to make choices in our code using conditional statements (`if`, `else`) and Boolean values (`True`, `False`).
* Conditional statements can change the code behaviour based on certain conditions. 
* The idea is simple: **IF** a condition is met, **THEN** a set of actions is performed.

---

### if else Example 1

::: {style="font-size: 200%;"}

```python
temperature = 17

if temperature > 25:
    print("it is hot!")
else:
    print("it is not hot!")
    
print(temperature)    
```

```
it is not hot
```
:::

---

### if else Example 2

::: {style="font-size: 200%;"}

```python
temperature = 30

if temperature > 25:
    print("it is hot!")
else:
    print("it is not hot!")
    
print(temperature)    
```

```
it is hot
```
:::

---

### `if` statement without `else`

* The code indented under the if-statement is not executed if the condition is not True. Instead, code under the else-statement gets executed.
* How about if without else?


::: {style="font-size: 140%;"}

```python
temperature = 17

if temperature > 25:
    print(temperature, "is greater than 25")
```

:::

---

### Conditional operator

::: {style="font-size: 140%;"}

```python
weather = "rain"

if weather == "rain":
    print("Wear a raincoat!")
else:
    print("No raincoat needed.")
```

```
Wear a raincoat!
```

:::


---

### if, elif and else

::: {style="font-size: 70%;"}
* We can link several conditions together using the “else if” -statement `elif.`
* Python checks the `elif` and else statements only if previous conditions were False.
* You can have multiple `elif` statements to check for additional conditions.

:::


::: {style="font-size: 120%;"}

```python
temperature = -3

if temperature > 0:
    print(temperature, "degrees celsius is above freezing")
elif temperature == 0:
    print(temperature, "degrees celsius is at the freezing point")
else:
    print(temperature, "degrees celsius is below freezing")
```

```
-3 degrees celsius is below freezing
```
:::

---


## Combinations
### Combining conditions

* We can also use and and or to combine multiple conditions on boolean values

| Keyword | Example | Description                   |
|---------|---------|-------------------------------|
| and     | a and b | True if both a and b are True |
| or      | a or b  | True if either a or b is True |


---

### Combination Example

::: {style="font-size: 120%;"}

```python
weather = "rain"
wind_speed = 14
comfort_limit = 10

# If it is windy or raining, print "stay at home",
# otherwise (else) print "go out and enjoy the weather!"
if (weather == "rain") or (wind_speed >= comfort_limit):
    print("Just stay at home")
else:
    print("Go out and enjoy the weather! :)")
```

```
Just stay at home
```

:::

---

### Combining for-loops and conditional statements

::: {style="font-size: 80%;"}
* We can also combine for-loops and conditional statements. 
* Let’s iterate over a list of temperatures, and check if the temperature is hot or not
:::

```python
temperatures = [0, 12, 17, 28, 30]

# For each temperature, if the temperature is greater than 25, print "..is hot"
for temperature in temperatures:
    if temperature > 25:
        print(temperature, "is hot")
    else:
        print(temperature, "is not hot")
```

```python
0 is not hot
12 is not hot
17 is not hot
28 is hot
30 is hot
```
