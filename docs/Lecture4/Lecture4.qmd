## Recap of Previous Lecture

- Descriptive Statistics
- Aggregation using `groupby`
- Merging dataframes


## Today's Lecture (1hr)
* We have a lot of GIS functions
* We are not going into the deep functions today
   - Intersect
   - Buffer
   - Clip
   - Interpolation
   - ....
* Instead, we want to choose a topic and explore functions from there

## Geospatial data and GeoPandas

* Geospatial data are data with location information
* The geometry variable indicates where the *data* is located


## Reading and Writing Spatial Data

### Reading Data
- Use `gpd.read_file()` to read various spatial data formats (e.g., Shapefiles, GeoJSON)

```python
  import geopandas as gpd
  data = gpd.read_file('path_to_file.shp')
```

---

### Writing Data

Use `gpd.to_file()` to write GeoDataFrames to different formats

```python
data.to_file('path_to_save_file.shp')
```

---

### Coordinate Reference Systems (CRS)
- Importance of CRS in spatial data
- Using `.crs` to check CRS
- Setting CRS during data read/write operations





## Population Distribution and Demographics: Census NZ 2023
* What are the age distribution patterns across different regions in New Zealand?
* How is the population of Māori descendants distributed across urban and rural areas?
* What are the key differences in population density among various ethnic groups?






## Summary
* To navigate complex datasets effectively, it's crucial to structure your code in a way that enhances readability and maintainability
* Python offers a rich ecosystem of libraries specifically designed for GIS and spatial analysis. We explored some key packages such as GeoPandas for spatial data frames
* The actual programming:
    - Pandas: Indexing, Filtering, Grouping, Join between dataframes
    - Geopandas: Hands-on experience in GIS using codes
