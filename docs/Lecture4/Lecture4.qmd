## Recap of Previous Lecture

- Descriptive Statistics
- Aggregation using `groupby`
- Merging dataframes

## Geospatial data and GeoPandas

* Geospatial data are data with location information
* The geometry variable indicates where the *data* is located

## Today's Lecture (1hr)
* We have a lot of GIS functions
* We are not going into the deep functions today
   - Intersect
   - Buffer
   - Clip
   - Interpolation
   - ....
* Instead, we want to choose a topic and explore functions from there

### Population Distribution and Demographics: Census NZ 2023
* What are the age distribution patterns across different regions in New Zealand?
* How is the population of MƒÅori descendants distributed across urban and rural areas?
* What are the key differences in population density among various ethnic groups?






## Summary
* To navigate complex datasets effectively, it's crucial to structure your code in a way that enhances readability and maintainability
* Python offers a rich ecosystem of libraries specifically designed for GIS and spatial analysis. We explored some key packages such as GeoPandas for spatial data frames
* The actual programming:
    - Pandas: Indexing, Filtering, Grouping, Join between dataframes
    - Geopandas: Hands-on experience in GIS using codes
