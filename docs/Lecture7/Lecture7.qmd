## Today's Lecture (1hr)
* Why do we need Object Oriented Programming
* What are the benefits of using OOP?
* Some examples


## Before we cover OOP...
* Let's go back to how we code.

```python
import geopandas as gpd
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

read file
assign variables
overwrite variables
analyse your work
plot some outputs
write some text
submit

```

## When your project gets bigger

You will likely end up in a complex code you can never explain to others (aka. Spaghetti code)


## What is Object Oriented Programming?
::: {.incremental}

* Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm based on the concept of objects ([Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming))
* OOP is the most popular programming paradigm used for software development 
* OOP is taught as the standard way to code for most of a programmer’s educational career.
* What we have covered in this course so far is procedural programming

:::


## Object
* Attributes: What an object is/has
    - name, age, height
* Methods: what an object can co
    - east, sleep, play


## Class

::: {style="font-size: 70%;"}
* A class is a user-defined data type. 
* A `class` makes it easier to represent real-world objects in computer programming by minimising unnecessary, repeated small pieces of code.
* It consists of data members and member functions, which can be accessed and used by creating an instance of that class.

## Class
* In an empty `.py` file, you can write:


```python
class Car:
    pass

```

* If the file is small, you can keep it in the main `python` file
* But if the file gets bigger, you might want to consider creating a separate file.

```python
# in your main file
from cars import Car

```

## Creating a class and an object
Let's create your first OOP!

```python
class Car: 
    def __init__(self):   # self is an instance (i.e. building a house) 
                          # that doesn't appear in the object
    def # What to do
    
    def # What to do

```


## Four pillars in OOP

## Inheritance
* To create an object that inherits the methods and properties of another object
* A parent class and a child class
* Use `super()` to inherit parent classin

![](Figs/inherit.png){fig-align="center"}


## Polymorphism - process of using for more than one purpose
* Poly = many / morph = forms
* You can have one function or object that can be used in different ways


![](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:720/format:webp/1*N7cKjbtQzpU3jCx_00OYRg.png){fig-align="center"}


## Polymorphism
* Example: `+` operator

![](Figs/polymorphism.png){fig-align="center"}

## Encapsulation
* Encapsulation is the process of making data private by wrapping data and its methods in a ‘capsule’ or unit
* It can not be accessed or modified outside of that unit
* In Python, we can make variables private by prefixing the variable name with a double underscore `__`

## Encapsulation
![](Figs/encapsulation2.png){fig-align="center"}

::: {style="font-size: 50%;"}
* Private Attribute: The dog's name (`__name`) is private, meaning it can't be accessed directly from outside the class.
* Public Methods: The `get_name` and `set_name` methods allow you to safely access and change the dog's name.
* Controlled Access: You can only change or get the dog's name using the methods provided (`set_name` and `get_name`), which keeps the data safe and consistent.
:::


## Why is it helpful to make some attributes private in a class?
* Because it allows you to control how those attributes are accessed and modified. 
* You can ensure that it's only changed in specific, intended ways. 
* Prevents accidental or harmful changes to the data, which can lead to bugs or unexpected behaviour in your program.

## Real-World Example of Encapsulation:
::: {style="font-size: 50%;"}
* Imagine you’re building software for a coffee shop. You might have a class that represents a coffee machine. 
* The coffee machine has many internal components, like water levels, temperature settings, and a coffee bean grinder.
* `water_level`, `temp`, `set_grind_for_espresso()`

## Abstraction
::: {style="font-size: 70%;"}
* Abstraction is about keeping the process simple by hiding unnecessary details from the user
* e.g. Car
* Abstraction is about keeping the internal mechanics of the code hidden from the user. 
* This reduces the complexity of the code, and ensures that we only concentrate on what is important.
:::

![](Figs/abstraction.png){fig-align="center"}

## Abstraction
* **Key Takeaway**: Abstraction enforces a contract. Every car must have a model, but the specifics are determined by each subclass.
* **Abstract Class (Car)**: Sets a standard that every car subclass must have a car_model method.
* **Purpose of Abstract Class**: Ensures the focus is on WHAT should be implemented, not HOW.
* **Subclasses (Tesla and BMW)**: Implement the car_model method, defining HOW it should work for each specific car.
