## Today's Lecture (1hr)
* Why do we need Object Oriented Programming
* What are the benefits of using OOP?
* Some examples


## What is Object Oriented Programming?
::: {.incremental}

* Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm based on the concept of objects ([Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming))
* Attributes or properties
* Functions or methods
* OOP is the most popular programming paradigm used for software development and is taught as the standard way to code for most of a programmerâ€™s educational career.
* What we have covered in this course so far is procedural programming

:::


## Inside the Object
* Attributes: What an object is/has
    - name, age, height
* Methods: what an object can co
    - east, sleep, play

### Class

* A class is a user-defined data type. 
* It consists of data members and member functions, which can be accessed and used by creating an instance of that class.

### Class

```python
class Car:
    pass

```


* If the file is small, you can keep it in the main `python` file
* But if the file gets bigger, you might want to consider creating a separate file.

```python
# in your main file
from cars import Car

```

---

### Class

```python


```

## Summary
* To navigate complex datasets effectively, it's crucial to structure your code in a way that enhances readability and maintainability
* Python offers a rich ecosystem of libraries specifically designed for GIS and spatial analysis. We explored some key packages such as GeoPandas for spatial data frames
* The actual programming:
    - Pandas: Indexing, Filtering, Grouping, Join between dataframes
    - Geopandas: Hands-on experience in GIS using codes
