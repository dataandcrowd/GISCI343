## Recap of Previous Lecture

- melt and cast
- Brief ideation of GIS and maps
- Introduction to `geopandas`



## Today's Lecture

- Vector tools using `geopandas`
- Distance
- MAUP


## Lab 1 Assignment

* Q4 was critical
* You either can create a second dictionary
* Or `for loop` the rows
* or `melt` and `cast` the wide column dataframes

<br>

Let's go through some codes!



## Vector Tools {.smaller}


![](Figs/vector_tools.jpg)


::: {.notes}
* `buffer`
  - A buffer is a zone created around a spatial feature at a defined distance. 
  - This zone can be used to analyse proximity relationships

* `clip`
  - The Clip tool allows you to extract a specific area from one dataset using another dataset as a boundary. 
  - It‚Äôs useful for refining datasets, focusing on areas of interest, and reducing file sizes.

* `dissolve`
  *The Dissolve tool helps merge multiple features into one based on a common attribute. 
  *This is useful when simplifying datasets and aggregating spatial data.

* `difference (Erase)`
  * The Difference (Erase) tool removes the areas of one layer that overlap with another layer. 
  * Cutting out unwanted features from a dataset.


* `intersect`
  * The Intersect tool extracts the overlapping portions of two layers. 
  * Commonly used in spatial analysis to find common areas between datasets.

* `merge`
  * Merging combines two or more layers into one


* `Spatial Join`
  * A spatial join matches rows from the Join Features values to the Target Features values based on their relative spatial locations

## Vector tools in Python

* Let's go to colab!

```python
import geopandas as gpd
from shapely.geometry import Polygon, Point, LineString

gpd.buffer() # buffer
gpd.clip() # clip
gpd.overlay(A, B, how='difference') # difference(erase)
gpd.dissolve(by='region') # dissolve

```

## Your turn

Follow the steps below to perform spatial and statistical analysis using the 2023 population data:

```python
pop23 = gpd.read_file('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dataandcrowd/GISCI343/main/docs/Lecture5/data/pop23.gpkg')
```

<br>

1. Calculate the centroid of each region
2. Measure distances from Wellington
3. Classify total population using Jenks natural breaks (k = 5) - Go back to tutorial
4. Dissolve regions by North and South Islands:
5. Calculate total population per island and percentage share: 






## Summary: üåê Core GIS Concepts {.smaller}

- **GIS = Attribute + Location** ‚Äî everything is *georeferenced*
- **Vector vs Raster**:  
  - *Vector*: points, lines, polygons  
  - *Raster*: grids of pixels (e.g., satellite images)
- **Reference vs Thematic Maps**:  
  - Reference = location/navigation  
  - Thematic = patterns/relationships
- **Projections & CRS**:  
  - Map distortion comes from projecting 3D ‚Üí 2D  
  - Use `EPSG` codes (e.g., 4326 for WGS84)
- **MAUP**:  
  - *Scale Effect*: unit size changes results  
  - *Zoning Effect*: how units are drawn matters
- **Spatial relationships**:  
  - `within`, `intersects`, `contains`, `touches`, etc.

## üíª Python Practicals with GeoPandas {.smaller}
- **Data Wrangling** with `pandas`:  
  - `melt()`, `groupby()`, and data visualisation using `seaborn`
- **Load Spatial Data**:  
  - `gpd.read_file()` for Shapefiles, GeoJSON, GPKG
- **Understand Geometry**:  
  - Access `.geometry`, filter with `.loc[]`, `squeeze()` single-row GeoDataFrames
- **Work with CRS**:  
  - Check with `.crs`  
  - Reproject using `.to_crs(epsg=...)`
- **Spatial Joins**:  
  - `gpd.sjoin()` to combine points with polygons based on spatial logic
- **Buffering & Overlay**:  
  - Use `.buffer()` for zones (e.g., 250km)  
  - `gpd.overlay()` for geometric operations like `difference`, `intersection`
- **Map Visualisation**:  
  - Plot with `.plot()` and customize using `matplotlib`
