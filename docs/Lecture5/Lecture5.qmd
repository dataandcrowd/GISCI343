## Recap of Previous Lecture

- melt and cast
- Brief ideation of GIS and maps
- Introduction to `geopandas`



## Today's Lecture

- Vector tools using `geopandas`
- Raster tools using `rasterio``
- Distance
- Population density
- Classified choropleth maps
- barcharts...



## Lab 1 Assignment

* Q4 was critical
* You either can create a second dictionary
* Or `for loop` the rows
* or `melt` and `cast` the wide column dataframes

<br>

Let's go through some codes!



## Vector Tools {.smaller}


![](Figs/vector_tools.jpg)


::: {.notes}
* `buffer`
  - A buffer is a zone created around a spatial feature at a defined distance. 
  - This zone can be used to analyse proximity relationships

* `clip`
  - The Clip tool allows you to extract a specific area from one dataset using another dataset as a boundary. 
  - It’s useful for refining datasets, focusing on areas of interest, and reducing file sizes.

* `dissolve`
  *The Dissolve tool helps merge multiple features into one based on a common attribute. 
  *This is useful when simplifying datasets and aggregating spatial data.

* `difference (Erase)`
  * The Difference (Erase) tool removes the areas of one layer that overlap with another layer. 
  * Cutting out unwanted features from a dataset.


* `intersect`
  * The Intersect tool extracts the overlapping portions of two layers. 
  * Commonly used in spatial analysis to find common areas between datasets.

* `merge`
  * Merging combines two or more layers into one


* `Spatial Join`
  * A spatial join matches rows from the Join Features values to the Target Features values based on their relative spatial locations

## Vector tools in Python

* Let's go to colab!

```python
import geopandas as gpd
from shapely.geometry import Polygon, Point, LineString

gpd.buffer() # buffer
gpd.clip() # clip
gpd.overlay(A, B, how='difference') # difference(erase)
gpd.dissolve(by='region') # dissolve

```

## Your turn

Follow the steps below to perform spatial and statistical analysis using the 2023 population data:

```python
pop23 = gpd.read_file('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dataandcrowd/GISCI343/main/docs/Lecture5/data/pop23.gpkg')
```

<br>

1. Calculate the centroid of each region
2. Measure distances from Wellington
3. Classify total population using Jenks natural breaks (k = 5) - Go back to tutorial
4. Dissolve regions by North and South Islands:
5. Calculate total population density by region



## Raster {.smaller}

So far we’ve been working mainly with vector data using `geopandas`: lines, points, polygons

The basemap tiles we’ve using are an example of raster data

* Raster data:
  - Gridded or pixelated
  - Maps easily to an array — it’s the representation for digital images


![](https://musa-550-fall-2023.github.io/content/week-5/imgs/raster-intro.png){fig-align=center}


## Examples

* Continuous rasters
    - Multispectral satellite imagery, e.g., the Landsat satellite
    - Digital Elevation Models (DEMs)
    - Maps of canopy height derived from LiDAR data.

* Categorical rasters
    - Land cover or land-use maps.
    - Tree height maps classified as short, medium, and tall trees.
    - Snowcover masks (binary snow or no snow)

## Resolution

The spatial distance that a single pixel covers on the ground.

![](https://musa-550-fall-2023.github.io/content/week-5/imgs/raster-resolution.png)


## Extent
The bounding box that covers the entire extent of the raster data.

![](https://musa-550-fall-2023.github.io/content/week-5/imgs/raster-extent-2.png){fig-align=center}


## Affine transformation: Transforming from pixel space to real space

* A mapping from pixel space (rows and columns of the image) to the x and y coordinates defined by the CRS
* Typically a six parameter matrix defining the origin, pixel resolution, and rotation of the raster image


## Multi-band raster data

Colour images are multi-band rasters!

![](https://musa-550-fall-2023.github.io/content/week-5/imgs/color-images.png)


## Multi-band raster data

Each band measures the light reflected from different parts of the electromagnetic spectrum.

![](https://musa-550-fall-2023.github.io/content/week-5/imgs/multi-band-raster.png)


## The raster format: GeoTIFF

* A standard .tif image format with additional spatial information embedded in the file, which includes metadata for:
  * Geotransform, e.g., extent, resolution
  * Coordinate Reference System (CRS)
  * Values that represent missing data (NoDataValue)

![](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/A5GphlWJLDQ/maxresdefault.jpg){fig-align=center}


## Tools for raster data

* Lots of different options: really just working with arrays
* One of the first options: Geospatial Data Abstraction Library (GDAL)
* Low level and not really user-friendly
* A more recent, much more Pythonic package: `rasterio`
* We’ll use `rasterio` for the majority of our raster analysis


## Getting Started with `rasterio`

```python
import rasterio as rio

elev = rio.open('elevation.tif')
elev.crs
elev.bounds # The bounds
elev.count # The number of bands available
elev.indexes # The band numbers that are available
elev.shape # Number of pixels in the x and y directions
elev.meta # # All of the meta data

```

## Slope

* The Slope tool identifies the steepness at each cell of a raster surface. 
* The lower the slope value, the flatter the terrain; the higher the slope value, the steeper the terrain.
* The Slope tool uses a 3 by 3 window of cells to compute the value (but the windows can change)

## Mask raster by vector boundaries
Cuts out a portion of a raster dataset, mosaic dataset, or image service layer.

## Zonal statistics

* calculates statistics on cell values of a raster (a value raster) within the zones defined by another dataset.

## Summary 

::: {style="font-size: 85%;"}

- Use **vector tools** (e.g., `buffer`, `clip`, `dissolve`, `spatial join`) to analyse **discrete features** like roads, cities, and regions.
- Use **raster tools** (e.g., slope, masking, zonal statistics) to explore **continuous surfaces** such as elevation, temperature, and land cover.
- Combine both to uncover **where** things happen and **how much** — e.g., population density by region, slope-based risk zones.
- Tools like `geopandas` and `rasterio` bring these analyses together through **code-driven, reproducible workflows**.
